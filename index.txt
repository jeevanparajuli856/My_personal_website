rgba(255,133,83,.3);
box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35) 0px 5px 15px;
const element = document.getElementById("element-to-be-animated");

element.addEventListener("animationend", () => {
    // Set your final state here. For example:
    element.style["opacity"] = 1;
}, { once: true });

The option once: true tells the engine to remove the event listener after its execution, leaving your application fresh and clean.

I have created a JSFiddle to show how it works.
